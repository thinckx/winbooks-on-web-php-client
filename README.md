# Winbooks On Web PHP Client

![Tests](https://github.com/whitecube/winbooks-on-web-php-client/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## Installation

```
composer require whitecube/winbooks-on-web-php-client
```

## Usage

### Authentication
Before you can do anything, you have to authenticate with the API. This is done with OAuth 2.0, so you will need the e-mail and the Exchange Token provided by Winbooks on Web. You can get those by following [these steps](https://help.winbooks.be/display/DEV/Grant+an+access+to+your+license).

When you have those ready to go, you can use them to ask the API to grant you an Access Token and a Refresh Token. The Access Token is necessary to authorise every request, and the Refresh Token is used to get a new Access Token if it has expired.

When you create an instance of the Winbooks client, you can give it the Access Token and the Refresh Token right away if you have them. If you don't, you can simply call `authenticate($email, $exchange_token)` afterwards, which will grant you those tokens which you should then save and reuse the next time you make an instance of the client.

```php
use Whitecube\Winbooks\Winbooks;

// $access_token and $refresh_token can be null if you do not have them yet
$winbooks = new Winbooks($access_token, $refresh_token);

if(! $winbooks->authenticated()) {
    [$access_token, $refresh_token] = $winbooks->authenticate($email, $exchange_token);
    // Store the tokens somewhere safe
}

// Now you can start using the API
```

### Specifying the folder
You can set the folder once and it will be used for all subsequent requests.

```php
$winbooks->folder('TEST_FOLDER');

$winbooks->get(/*...*/)
```

### Getting data
All getter methods will return the JSON data directly from WoW, already decoded and wrapped into Object Model instances when possible.

To get all results from an object model, use the `all($object_model)` method.

```php
$customers = $winbooks->all('Customers');
```

> **Warning**: Depending on the size of your dataset and the server's memory limit, `all()` can cause critical server errors since its results are not paginated. The API wrapper will continue fetching objects until Winbook's REST API indicates everything has been transferred. This is quite a big issue, documented in [Winbook's documentation](https://help.winbooks.be/display/DEV/1.+Query+Data#id-1.QueryData-E.Chunkingdata), which will not be fixed in this package until Winbook's REST API will implement proper pagination options.

To get a single result from an object model, use the `get($object_model, $code)` method.

> **Note**: you can substitute $code for the ID if you have it.

```php
$vlad = $winbooks->get('Customer', 'VLADIMIR');
// With ID
$vlad = $winbooks->get('Customer', '4713a22f-ebc0-ea11-80c7-0050s68cc4a2');
```

To specify the amount of nested data you want ([`maxLevel` parameter](https://help.winbooks.be/display/DEV/1.+Query+Data)), you can pass it as a third param to the get method.
```php
$vlad = $winbooks->get('Customer', 'VLADIMIR', 3);
```

### Inserting data
A generic way to insert data is by using the `add($object_model, $code, $data)` method:

```php
$winbooks->add('Customer', 'VLADIMIR', [
    'Memo' => 'A Memo for Vladimir',
    // ...
]);

// You can also add multiple objects at once:

$winbooks->addMany('Customers', [
    [
        'Code' => 'VLADIMIR',
        'Memo' => 'A Memo for Vladimir',
        // ...
    ],
    [
        'Code' => 'ALICE',
        'Memo' => 'A Memo for Alice',
        // ...
    ]
]);
```

You can also use the provided Model classes instead. These classes are named like the object models documented in the [Winbooks On Web documentation](https://help.winbooks.be/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54529841).

```php
use Whitecube\Winbooks\Models\Customer;

$vlad = new Customer(['Code' => 'VLADIMIR']);
$alice = new Customer(['Code' => 'ALICE']);

$winbooks->addModel($vlad);
// or multiple
$winbooks->addModels([$vlad, $alice]);
```

### Updating data
```php
$winbooks->update('Customer', 'ALICE', [
    'Memo' => 'This is an updated memo for Alice',
]);

// Or multiple

$winbooks->updateMany('Customers', [
    [
        'Code' => 'VLADIMIR',
        'Memo' => 'This is an updated memo for Vladimir',
    ],
    [
        'Code' => 'ALICE',
        'Memo' => 'This is an updated memo for Alice',
    ]
]);
```

### Deleting data
```php
$winbooks->delete('Customer', 'VLADIMIR');
```

## Tests

This project uses [PEST](https://pestphp.com/) for tests.

First, create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` and fill it with your API testing credentials.

To run the tests:
```
./vendor/bin/pest
```

with code coverage (needs pcov or xdebug)
```
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```
